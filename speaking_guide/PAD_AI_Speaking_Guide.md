# PAD.AI — Speaking Guide

## What PAD.AI Is

PAD.AI is an AI-powered platform that makes co-buying a home actually work. Right now, nearly half of Americans would consider buying a home with someone else — a friend, sibling, partner — but there's zero infrastructure to support it. People are managing shared mortgages through group texts and handshake deals, and it falls apart when life happens: someone wants to move, gets married, loses a job. PAD.AI solves this by matching compatible co-buyers based on lifestyle and finances, providing legally-vetted ownership agreements, and then managing the entire co-ownership relationship — automated billing, communication, maintenance, and AI-powered decision support. Think of it as the operating system for shared homeownership.

## Speaking Points

### The Problem
- Home prices up 56% in 5 years — first-time buyer age is now 35
- Gen Z ownership at 8%, but 87% still want to own
- 48% of Americans would co-buy; 70% of Gen Z would
- No tools exist — people use group texts and spreadsheets
- Three things break: expectations, money, decisions

### What We Do (3 Pillars)
1. **Match** — Compatible co-buyers by lifestyle + finances
2. **Protect** — Legally-vetted ownership agreements
3. **Manage** — Ongoing billing, comms, maintenance, AI decisions

### The Market
- 2018: 12% share, 640K units, ~$166B
- 2024: 29% share, 1.25M units, ~$505B
- 2030: 35% share, 1.86M units, ~$898B
- "One in three homes will be co-bought by 2030"
- $600B threshold crossed in 2026

### Our Moat
- Dynamic onboarding survey — co-buyer compatibility data no one else has
- Reputation profiles build over time
- Data lock-in: financial, comms, maintenance history all lives in PAD.AI
- "Zillow can't replicate our database overnight"

### Why Now / Why Us
- Real estate has the lowest automation of any major industry
- Competitors focus on vacation homes or investor matches — nobody solves primary residence + long-term management
- Personal experience: "I'm living this problem right now"

### Ask for Feedback
- Would you use this?
- Do you know anyone who's co-bought?
- What's the scariest part of co-buying?
- What makes this a must-have vs. nice-to-have?
