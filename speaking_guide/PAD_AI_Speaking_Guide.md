# PART 1: FULL SPEAKING DIALOGUE

*Use this as your talk track when sharing PAD.AI with potential users, advisors, or co-founders. Adapt tone based on audience — this is written conversational, not pitch-deck formal.*

## THE OPEN (30 seconds)

"So here's the thing — homeownership in America is broken. Home prices are up 54% in five years. The average first-time buyer is now 35 years old — that used to be 29. And if you're Gen Z? Only 8% own homes. In LA, only about 20% of Millennials own. Meanwhile, 87% of Gen Z still say owning a home is part of the American Dream. The desire is there. The path isn't."

## THE INSIGHT (30 seconds)

"Here's what's interesting — 48% of Americans say they'd consider co-buying with friends or family. 70% of Gen Z would consider buying with a friend. And 1 in 4 co-buyers say it's the only way they could afford a home at all. But right now, co-buying is still a niche practice — mostly among close friends and family — because the infrastructure doesn't exist to make it safe, manageable, or scalable."

## THE PROBLEM (45 seconds)

"When people do co-buy today, it's messy. According to US CoBuy surveys, co-owners run into problems around three things: expectation setting, money, and decision-making. Life changes happen — someone gets married, divorced, wants to move, loses a job — and there's no system to handle it. No clear legal structure. No communication framework. No automated way to manage shared finances. People are literally buying homes together using group texts and spreadsheets. And it falls apart."

"I actually just went through this personally — separating from a partner, big house, great rate, and now it's like: do we keep it? Rent it? Split it into two units? Sell? There's no tool that helps you navigate any of that."

## THE SOLUTION (45 seconds)

"That's PAD.AI. It stands for — think of it as your pad, your place, powered by AI. We're building an AI-driven platform that makes fractional homeownership safe, accessible, and manageable. We do three things:

One — we help match compatible co-buyers. Not just financially, but in terms of lifestyle, expectations, and what they actually want from shared ownership.

Two — we provide legally-vetted ownership agreements. Real structure, not handshake deals.

Three — we offer ongoing co-ownership management. Automated billing, a communication hub, document storage, maintenance coordination, and AI-powered decision support.

Think of it as a virtual HOA for co-owners — but one that actually works for you, not against you."

## THE ONBOARDING DIFFERENTIATOR (30 seconds)

"One of the things we're building that I'm really excited about is the onboarding survey. When you sign up, we don't just ask for your financials. We ask: What's your tolerance for clutter? How involved do you want to be in maintenance decisions? What does 'shared space' mean to you? This isn't a one-size-fits-all questionnaire — it's dynamic, personalized to each user. You check the boxes that matter to YOU. And then we use that data to match you with co-buyers who actually align — or to flag potential friction points with someone you already know before you sign anything."

"That survey data becomes our moat. It's the thing no competitor can replicate overnight, because it takes time and trust to build."

## THE MARKET (30 seconds)

"Now here's the market opportunity. We've been deep in the data — verified it across multiple sources, cross-checked every number. In 2018, co-buying was 12% of all home sales — about 640,000 transactions at a median price of $259K. By 2024, that share has more than doubled to 29% — roughly 1.25 million units and about $505 billion in annual revenue.

By 2030, co-buying is projected to hit 35% of all home sales — one in every three homes sold. That's a nearly $900 billion market. $898 billion to be exact. The market crosses the $600 billion threshold in 2026."

## THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE (30 seconds)

"There are a couple of players out there. There's a company focused on co-buying second homes — vacation properties, that kind of thing. And there's another model where you find an investor to help you buy, but then you're in a relationship with someone more financially sophisticated who might not have your best interests at heart. Neither of them is solving the core problem: how do regular people buy a PRIMARY residence together and actually manage that relationship long-term?"

"And honestly? Real estate as an industry has really low automation. The agents aren't techie. Nobody has sat down and said, 'This entire process can be streamlined.' That's our opening."

## THE MOAT & NETWORK EFFECTS (30 seconds)

"Our competitive advantage builds over time. Phase one is core infrastructure — the platform, the agreements, the billing. Phase two is operations and that dynamic survey system, the co-owner reputation profiles. Phase three — 2027 and beyond — is network effects.

Once people are using our platform to manage their co-ownership, once their financial data, their communication history, their maintenance records are all in PAD.AI — it becomes really hard to leave. Like how developers build on Claude or companies build on Microsoft's ecosystem. That database of co-owner preferences, compatibility data, reputation scores — that's something Zillow can't just come in and replicate."

## THE ASK / CLOSE (15 seconds)

"Right now, we're refining the MVP, validating the product with real users, and I'd love your honest feedback. What resonates? What doesn't? Would YOU use something like this? Do you know anyone who's co-buying or has co-bought? I want to hear the real talk — what would make this a must-have versus a nice-to-have?"

## THE HOOK
- Home prices up 54% in 5 years
- First-time buyer age: 35 (was 29)
- Gen Z ownership: only 8%
- 87% still want the American Dream
- 48% would co-buy. 70% of Gen Z would.
- 1 in 4 co-buyers: only way they can afford it

## THE PROBLEM (3 words each)

## WHAT PAD.AI DOES (3 pillars)
1. **MATCH** — Compatible co-buyers (lifestyle + financial)
2. **PROTECT** — Legally-vetted ownership agreements
3. **MANAGE** — Ongoing co-ownership (billing, comms, maintenance, AI decisions)

## THE ONBOARDING HOOK
- Dynamic survey, not a static form
- "What's your tolerance for clutter?"
- Each user customizes their profile
- Match co-buyers by alignment percentage
- Survey data = our moat
- "Reputation profiles" for co-buyers

## MARKET NUMBERS (memorize these)
| | 2018 | 2024 | 2030 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Share** | 12% | 29% | 35% |

- "More than doubled in six years"
- "One in three homes by 2030"
- "$600B threshold crossed in 2026"
- "Nearly $900 billion market"

## COMPETITORS (why we win)
- Competitor A: vacation/second homes only
- Competitor B: investor matches you (power imbalance)
- Neither solves PRIMARY residence + ongoing management
- Real estate = low automation industry
- "Nobody sat down and said this can be streamlined"

## MOAT / NETWORK EFFECTS
- Phase 1: Core infrastructure (2026)
- Phase 2: Operations + surveys + reputation (2026-27)
- Phase 3: Network effects (2027+)
- Data lock-in: financial, comms, maintenance history
- "Zillow can't replicate our database overnight"
- Tiered decision-making: AI handles small, humans handle big

- **MVP**: Financial automation, communication hub, document storage, survey (basic)

- **Phase 3**: Marketplace (browse co-owners, not just homes), network effects
- **Phase 4**: Virtual HOA platform (full maturity)

## USE CASES TO MENTION
- Friends buying a duplex/triplex together (don't have to live together)
- Family members pooling resources
- Divorce/separation — managing shared property
- Second-home partnerships gone wrong
- "I have friends who already do this — they just have no tools"

## PERSONAL STORY HOOKS
- "I'm literally living this right now — separating, shared property, no tools"
- "A friend owns property with someone — they use group texts"
- "Commercial real estate people co-own all the time — why not residential?"

## FEEDBACK QUESTIONS TO ASK
- Would you use this? Why / why not?
- Do you know anyone who's co-bought?
- What would make this a must-have vs. nice-to-have?
- What's the scariest part of co-buying to you?
- Would you trust AI to help with shared home decisions?

## THINGS TO NOT OVERCLAIM
- Data was cross-checked through 9 iterations
- "People take AI output as fact — we verified every number"
- Use "projected" and "forecasted" — not guaranteed
- 2030 numbers are forecasts, not promises
